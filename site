<body>
<h3> Minecraft YouTuber Tournaments is a tournament for every youtuber from every country, this project is for try a mcc but for youtuber didn't can participate to the real mcc.
I explain this event here with 4 Questions. <h3>

<h2> Why participate? <h2>
<h3> Minecraft YouTuber Tournaments is for fun if you want see your skills or other you can do that. This stay a reconsitution of the mcc so it' s not perfect, remind i'm create that alone. <h3>

<h2> why recreate mcc of I can try to join mcc? <h2>
<h3> for the reason, it's hard to participate to the real mcc and this "myt" is for youtuber but not 2 million subscribers minimum, you only need skll in the myt. <h3>

<h2> No bugs and well done map? <h2> <h3> I'm not the best with plugins and command but this event is not nothing so yes for the myt I not stay with my bad command and plugins level. <h3>

<h2> players stay serious? <h2>
<h3> yes it's hard to keep players serious so if a players are not serious and do stupid things he lose 1 point if he do that 2 time and lose 2 point it's the end of the event for him.. <h3>

<h2> myt is just a reconsitutionod the mcc, it's not maid by professional people it's just for test you skills. Remember mcc is really better...
